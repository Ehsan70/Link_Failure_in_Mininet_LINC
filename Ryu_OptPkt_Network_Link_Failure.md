<b>Goal</b>: Seting up LINC-OE simple optical topology and a simple packet topology, both controlled by Ryu. 
The controller runs Spanning Tree protocol for detecting topology change.  
<b>Requirements:</b>
A basic knowlege of LINC-OE, TAP interfaces, Ryu and linux CLI is helpful. 
Doing these tutorials tutorial is a must: 
[1](https://github.com/Ehsan70/Mininet_LINC_script/blob/master/LINCoe_and_iControl.md) and [2](https://github.com/Ehsan70/Link_Failure_in_Mininet_LINC/blob/master/OptPkt_Network_Link_Failure.md)

<b>Environment: </b> I have used the VM from sdn hub, I recommond you do the same. Link for installation is provided below: http://sdnhub.org/tutorials/sdn-tutorial-vm/

<b>Road Map: </b>This document has two sections for setup: 

 1. Setting up the network   
 2. Doing tests </br>

Then the tutorial would run couple of experminets. After the experminet the tutorial talkes about the details of the network and what is goingt on under the hood.   

<b>Notations: </b>
 - `>` means the linuc command line <br>
 - `iControl>` Means the iControll command line
 
 
# 1. Setting up the network
